          description="Founded in 2020 by a team of sports scientists and professional athletes, 
                     Zenith Zap was born from a simple question: why do generic sports drinks 
                     fail to address the specific needs of athletes? Our founder, former Olympic 
                     medalist Dr. Alex Chen, collaborated with nutritionists to develop formulas 
                     that truly understand the athletic body's demands during different training phases."

                     Our proprietary Tri-Phase Formulaâ„¢ addresses the specific needs of athletes before, during, 
                     and after activity. Each formula contains precisely calculated ratios of electrolytes, 
                     carbohydrates, and recovery compounds that have been tested in real athletic environments."
